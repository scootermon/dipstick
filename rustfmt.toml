# See: <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt>

# rustfmt contains a number of options that aren't enforced by default (yet).
# We want to have a consistent style across the codebase, so we enable them here.
# Notably we don't want to customize any other settings, we just want to enable rules
# that are set to "preserve" by default.
